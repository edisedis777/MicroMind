## 🎯 Purpose & Philosophy

In our fast-paced world, we often rush from one task to another without taking time to reflect on what we've learned or experienced. MicroMind was created based on the principle that **small, consistent reflections compound into significant personal growth**.

### The Three Pillars of Daily Reflection

1. **📚 Learning** - "What did I learn today?"
   - Reinforces knowledge retention
   - Helps identify patterns in your learning journey
   - Celebrates daily growth, no matter how small

2. **❓ Questioning** - "What's one question I have?"
   - Cultivates curiosity and critical thinking
   - Identifies areas for future exploration
   - Maintains a beginner's mindset

3. **💡 Ideas** - "What idea came to mind?"
   - Captures creative sparks before they fade
   - Documents your thought evolution
   - Encourages innovative thinking

## 📱 Usage Example

Here's what a typical day with MicroMind looks like:

### Morning Reflection (2 minutes)
```
📚 What did I learn today?
"Discovered that TypeScript's 'as const' assertion can make arrays readonly and preserve literal types"

❓ What's one question I have?
"How can I better structure my React components to avoid prop drilling?"

💡 What idea came to mind?
"What if I created a custom hook that combines localStorage with React state for better data persistence?"
```

### The Power of Consistency
After 30 days, you'll have:
- 30 new learnings documented
- 30 questions to explore further
- 30 ideas captured for future projects
- A clear picture of your intellectual growth
